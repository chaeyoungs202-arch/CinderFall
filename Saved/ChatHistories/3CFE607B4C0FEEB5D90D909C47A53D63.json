Since you have the PRO plan, you have access to additional capabilities including the open beta for blueprint editing. \n\nI can see you have several blueprints open in your editor including:\n- Player blueprint (BK_Player_v1)\n- AI control blueprints (AI_Control, AI_goblin, AI_reyezer, AI_shrooman, AI_Skeleton)\n- Input/animation blueprints (BK_Attack, BK_BP_Animate)\n- UI widget blueprint (WB_Inventory)\n\nWith your PRO plan, I can help you with:\n\n1. **Reading and analyzing** any of these blueprints in detail\n2. **Blueprint editing** (open beta) - though this requires upgrading to the latest plugin version and following setup instructions at docs.ludusengine.com\n3. **Advanced 3D model generation** with higher quality modes\n4. **Detailed asset analysis** and code examination\n\nWould you like me to analyze any specific blueprint you have open, or is there something particular you'd like to work on? I can read the blueprint logic, explain how they work, or help you understand the relationships between these different AI and player systems."},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0b718d-ed56-6cc2-8000-e7bbc27e9b06"}},{"type":"checkpoint","info":{"id":"1f0b718e-539c-68c2-8001-5832e3559934"}}]}],"Mapping":{"node_agent_names":{"pairs":[]}}}
